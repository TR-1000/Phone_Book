# Built With
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express
* Mongoose
* jQuery
* Materialize
* HTML
* CSS

# Known Issues
* Login Needs to be more secure. It's possible for multiple members to that the same username.
* By design, other users can create sign up for this app but they can't add to the collection. But if they know the address to the creation page they can bypass this.
* Image slideshow needs improvement. Some images are cut off or not rendered at all.
* Links to outside websites have not been enabled.

# Roadmap
* Securing passwords with encryption.
* Preventing duplicate usernames.
* Allow other users the create and edit there own collection.
* The ability to make blog posts about those collections.
* Ability for other users to comment on other collection.
* Tagging and search function.
* Tech news feed.

# Challenges
* Coming up with a name. Always a struggle.
* Deciding if this should be a personal or a community app.
* Technically the hardest thing was implementing authentication. Since the on;y time I tried it was during a class code along.
* Styling is always and challenges as I'm more about functionality than aesthetics.
* Never being satisfied.
